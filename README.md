# MNIST WITH KNN
## Using knn to classify 10000 testing pictures based on 60000 training pictures with Python
>### training and testing files are available in http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
>### require packages: 
>>> * struct ( unpack the resource files)
>>> * numpy ( calculating distance and sort the neighbors)
>>> * time ( find out the actual "wall clock" time that it took in KNN)
>>> * pickle ( store the result)


>### The code also calculates real time costs for each part and uses package pickle to store the sorted neighbors and distance matrix
